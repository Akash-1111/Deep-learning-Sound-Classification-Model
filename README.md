# Deep-learning-Sound-Classification-Model
The analysis and understanding of sound in the urban environment is very important to
the growth of cities and populations for the future. Studies have shown a direct impact
on health and child development from noise pollution

In this I have provded convolutional neural network which extracts features on the
basis of Mel-frequency cestrum coefficients which collectively make up an MFC. The
Mel-frequency cestrum (MFC) is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of
a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear Mel
scale of frequency which provides better accuracy compared to other pretrained models,
thus overcoming the drawbacks mentioned above for environmental sound
classification.
